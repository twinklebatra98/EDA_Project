# King County Housing EDA Project

This project explores housing sales data from King County, Washington, using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover key market insights. The analysis is tailored to the client, **Bonnie Brown**, a seller aiming to achieve high returns in a middle-class neighborhood within a short timeframe.

## Project Summary

- **Client Profile**: Bonnie Brown â€“ Homeowner looking to sell soon with maximum profit  
- **Objective**: Identify the best timing, renovation strategy, and neighborhood pricing trends to support a profitable sale  
- **Tools Used**: SQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, GeoJSON, Folium

## Key Insights

- Target Spring Sales: Aim to list and sell your property between April and June for optimal market conditions.

- Prioritize Visible Improvements: Focus renovation efforts on enhancing living space and home grade for maximum impact and return on investment.
